# BookstoreApp

This is a simple Bookstore application that uses:

 - Play Framework
 - Bootstrap
 - Dropzone JS and
 - DataTables

It is a Book CRUD + listing, with some nice features:
 - Book cover displays nicely within its container inside the add/edit modal
 - An auto-complete for the Book title field, that fetches titles from Google Books Api.
 - When a title is selected, the Author, Page and Description fields are filled automatically.
